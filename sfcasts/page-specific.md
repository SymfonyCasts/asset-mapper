# Page-Specific CSS & JS

Let's head over to `/admin`. Surprise! We *do* have an admin section on our site. Well... *sort of*. Right now, it's just a big rectangle, but this *represents* an admin section. Why do we have this? We're *pretending* we have a page or a section like this so we can add some extra custom CSS and JavaScript on *only* this page and section, instead of including it everywhere on our frontend, in the event our JavaScript and CSS is really heavy.

I typically try to *avoid* doing this, in favor of lazy Stimulus controllers that only load when I need them to. But *sometimes*, like in an admin area, you'll have a situation where you want an extra set of CSS and JavaScript. I'm going to show you how to do that with AssetMapper.

If we were using Encore, we'd open the `webpack.config.js` file and add a second entry file, which would result in a new CSS and JavaScript file. In AssetMapper, we can do something really similar.

Let's start with CSS. In the `/styles` directory, create an `admin.css` file and, inside, just to see if things are working, add an `.admin-wrapper` div with some XY padding. That's going to add a little space right here. *Then*, go into the template of this page - `/templates/admin/dashboard.html.twig` - and, right here, we're going to add `class=admin-wrapper"`. Now, this isn't going to work *yet*. Technically, that new `admin.css` file is available publicly because it's in the `/assets` directory. But to do that, we need a link tag. Let's add that!

There's nothing particularly special about this. We're going to say `{% block stylesheets %}` and `{% endblock %}` to override the `block` inside of our parent template. Inside, we'll call `{{ parent() }}` to include the normal stuff and, down here, add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ asset('styles/admin.css') }}">`. *And* let me fix my typo up here. Okay, *that's* what we want. And now you can see that the CSS *is* being applied because it's adding the padding to this area here. *Awesome*.

So... what about JavaScript? Once again, we'll start a lot like Encore. We'll create another file... maybe next to `app.js` called `admin.js`. And we'll add `console.log('admin.js file')` here so we can see that it's loading. Just like our CSS file, *this* file is publicly available, but nothing's actually loading it. If you remember from viewing the page source, the `app.js` file was being imported thanks to this `<script type="module">` line down here that imports `app`. We *automatically* get this, over in `base.html.twig`, from our `importmap` function.

You might think there would be an option you could pass here that would allow you to load `app.js` *and* `admin.js`, but surprisingly, there isn't. Why? Well, that's, in part, because it's not really necessary when we can easily add our *own* script tag. Inside `dashboard.html.twig`, we're going to do something pretty similar to what we did before. We're going to say `{% block javascripts %}`, `{% endblock %}`, and then `{{ parent }}`. Below that, we'll add a `<script>` tag with `type="module"`. And then, we're just going to code as if we were in a JavaScript file. Say `import` and then the path to our JavaScript file. Effectively, we want something like this - `/assets/admin.js` - but we're going to use the `asset()` function to point to it. Its logical path is literally `admin.js`. And that *should* be everything. if we head over, refresh... and check the console... got it! Our `admin.js` file *is* being loaded! If you check out the page source down here... *yep*. You can see `<script type="module">` from the `importmap` where it says `import 'app'`. Then, down here, we're importing the path. Notice that, in the original one, we say `import 'app'` and then we rely on the `importmap` to actually *map* that to its URL. That's *nice*, but it's not actually necessary. Putting the path right there works just fine, and that's what we're doing down here for ours. And *that's* page-specific JavaScript. *Super* easy.

Next: Let's talk *deployment* by setting our project up to deploy with "platform.sh".
